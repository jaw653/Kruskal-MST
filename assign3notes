To-Do:
------
-further test set.c to make sure edge cases are good
-? potentially just use qsort() in kruskal.c
-write kruskal.c
-make sure the newlines are in all the correct places for displaying set

questions:
----------
-I'm currently just printf'ing. Do we need to print to a file?
-how to handle an printing an empty set?
-do we need a -v option?

ideas to make program faster:
-----------------------------
-find the min and max while reading in the graph
