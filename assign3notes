To-Do:
------
-if failing on large cases, may have to do with quicksort. try removing the +1 in pivotlocation during recursion
-add space back in (?) before submitting
-currently working on displaying. Need to write displayNODE() and then test displayMST()...then just test and stuff...

-make a function, or add on functionality to count the total weight of the graph
-edit displayEDGE() to display node value(first node in adj list) weight
-further test set.c to make sure edge cases are good
-make sure the newlines are in all the correct places for displaying set

questions:
----------
-how to handle an printing an empty set?-you decide

ideas to make program faster:
-----------------------------
-currently searching for the main version of every vertex node to see if visited in the display function...might need to set visited for every node so that I can access the visited info in constant time rather than potentially linear time
-find the min and max while reading in the graph
