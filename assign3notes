To-Do:
------
-current problem is that edge u_index and v_index does not account for multiple of the same vertex. need to find a way to set newly inserted edges index markers to original of the vertex
	--> sort arr of verts. binary search it for newly inserted vert val. set edgetoinsert->u_index = that value's index

-further test set.c to make sure edge cases are good
-? potentially just use qsort() in kruskal.c
-write kruskal.c
-make sure the newlines are in all the correct places for displaying set

questions:
----------
-will the same vertex value be added twice to the tree? ...probably
-I'm currently just printf'ing. Do we need to print to a file?
-how to handle an printing an empty set?
-do we need a -v option?

ideas to make program faster:
-----------------------------
-program currently checks the entire array to see if vertex already exists probably results in linear time
-find the min and max while reading in the graph
-may need to keep a vertex array, sort that array, eliminate duplicates, then run makeset
